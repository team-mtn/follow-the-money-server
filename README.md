# Follow the Money

## Project Summary
Follow the money approaches the current political climate with an eye towards how much money presidential candidates are given and by whom. Trying to create a connection and awareness between the top level candidates, their donating block, and what is happening in the news. Hopefully highlighting corporate connections and social disconnection by revealing a candidates funding base. Of course we cannot provide the names of the contributors but you may infer the income level of those that donate by the range categories provided.

Remember, there is a maximum that can be contributed by a single person.

In no way is this an exhaustive capture of all the candiates that have applied for the presidnency but is meant to give an overview of the field with some compiled current news artilcles about them. A look is also taken at the five top funded candidates in a compartiive graph to reveal the disparity between the top two and all others. Here again we look to the range of donations to see the supporting base.

Folow the money is a class project designed to show off the coding talents of its creators. They use a SNER stack (SQL, Node.js, Express, React) with two API calls. One to the Federal Election Commission and another to newsapi.org. The project is broken down into two separate repos; the client side and the server side. This is done both for a separation of concerns and GitHub merge confilict prevention.

## Conflict Plan
* What will our group do when it encounters conflict?
  * Put it to a vote
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  * In our daily standup
  * Start from a place of support with a whole message
  * "I" statements
* What is your process to resolve conflicts?
  * Ensure members are fed and sufficiently watered
  * Allow members to take reasonably timed breaks
  * Create a safe space where everyone is able to be heard and valued
  * To change our coding environment, if needed.
* How and when will you escalate the conflict resolution?
  * Circle conflict resolution moment
    * Close laptops
    * Use "talking stick" to ensure all concerns are aired and expressed
    * When circle ends, the issue is CLOSED. Resolution complete.
  * If circle cannot solve bring issue to Nicholas

# Communication Plan
* Slack, hours are as needed.
