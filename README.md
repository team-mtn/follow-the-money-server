## Conflict Plan
* What will our group do when it encounters conflict?
  * Put it to a vote
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  * In our daily standup
  * Start from a place of support with a whole message
  * "I" statements
* What is your process to resolve conflicts?
  * Ensure members are fed and sufficiently watered
  * Allow members to take reasonably timed breaks
  * Create a safe space where everyone is able to be heard and valued
  * To change our coding environment, if needed.
* How and when will you escalate the conflict resolution?
  * Circle conflict resolution moment
    * Close laptops
    * Use "talking stick" to ensure all concerns are aired and expressed
    * When circle ends, the issue is CLOSED. Resolution complete.
  * If circle cannot solve bring issue to Nicholas
